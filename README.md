## Programming Practicum in C++ language

[EPP] (http://www.fullerton.edu/ecs/cs/resources/epp_exam.php) exam is the exam in Programming Proficiency that must pass to get the bachelor's degree of Computer Science or engineering in California State University, Fullerton.
So I took CPSC 301 to review, reinforce, and expand on programming concepts and skills.
Afterwards, I passed EPP part 1 and part 2.
